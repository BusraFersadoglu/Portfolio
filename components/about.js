      <p>
        Everyone has a journey and I have mine as well. I started as a teacher
        and then continued my journey to improve myself in the field of
        Frontend. During this process, I discovered the importance of loving
        research and learning in an industry where technology is rapidly
        changing and constantly requiring me to learn.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>I have been working in the Frontend field for a year now and I
        am determined to continue to improve myself. I have taken various
        trainings and obtained certificates to enhance my skills and knowledge.
        I have a passion for learning and researching, and this is one of my
        strengths. I am always working to specialize and excel in this field,
        and this journey will continue.
